    <h1>The Recipe Book</h1>
    <p>You flip through Miss Eleanor's old recipe book. Many pages are missing, but one stands out—it’s filled with strange symbols and coded writing.</p>
    <p>As you trace the words, the lights flicker. You suddenly feel dizzy.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="ending1.html">Try to decipher the recipe</a></li>
        <li><a href="ending2.html">Close the book and leave</a></li>
    </ul>
