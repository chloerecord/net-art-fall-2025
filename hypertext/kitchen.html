    <h1>The Kitchen</h1>
    <p>The kitchen is a mess—flour dusts the countertops, a bowl of half-mixed dough sits abandoned, and the oven is still warm. But something catches your eye—a pastry on the counter with an odd symbol carved into it.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="recipe.html">Examine the recipe book for clues</a></li>
        <li><a href="ending1.html">Eat the pastry and see what happens</a></li>
        <li><a href="index.html">Go back to the start</a></li>
