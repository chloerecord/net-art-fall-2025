  <p> 
    You got a new life, am I bothering you? Do you wanna talk? <br> share the last line, then we drink the wall 'til we wanna talk. I go 'round and 'round, satellite, spinning out, waiting for you to pull me in. I can see you're lonely down there, don't you know that I am right here? Spinning out, waiting for you to pull me in, I can see you're lonely down there, don't you know that I am right here? Spinning out, waiting for ya. I'm in an L.A. mood, I don't wanna talk to you. She said, "Give me a day or two." I go 'round and 'round, satellite, spinning out, waiting for you to pull me in. I can see you're lonely down there, don't you know that I am right here? Spinning out, waiting for you to pull me in, I can see you're lonely down there, don't you know that I am right here? Right here, right here, spinning out, waiting for ya. I'm here, right here, wishing I could be there for ya, be there for ya, be there for ya, for ya. Spinning out, waiting for ya to pull me in, I can see you're lonely down there, don't you know that I am right here? Spinning out, waiting for ya to pull me in, I can see you're lonely down there, don't you know that I am right here? Spinning out, waiting for ya to pull me in, I can see you're lonely down there, don't you know that I am right here?
